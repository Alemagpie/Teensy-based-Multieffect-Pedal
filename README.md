#Description:
A simple, Teensy-based, multieffect pedal for guitar. The processing is done with a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller paired with an Audio Shield extension card.

#TO-DO:
1) Finish parameter mapping system
2) Finish implementing non-linear distortion
3) Fix circuitry schematics
4) Add compatibility to all effects
5) Work on runtime effects chain

#Planned features:
- Ability to chain up to 5 effects
- Analize performance and optimize
