#Description:
A simple, Teensy-based, multieffect pedal for guitar. The processing is done with a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller paired with an Audio Shield extension card.

#CURRENT PROGRESS:
- Distortion effect with 4 parameters (gain, bias, treble, volume)
- Tremolo effect with 3 parameters (frequency, shape, depth)
- High-pass filter (1 pole)
- Low-pass filter (1 pole)
- LFO with 5 different waveform shapes
- Ability to chain multiple effects simultaneously
- Ability to change parameters' values in real time

#TO-DO:
- Implement more effects
- Create UI
